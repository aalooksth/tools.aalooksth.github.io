## GBD Tasklog
> Link: [GBD Tasklog](GBD-Tasklog.htm)

It's not easy to remember Hour log / Task log link as it
- changes every month
- is boring to type shortlink (All thanks to Manas dai and Nirmala di for creatng it every month and which is the basis of this tool.)

So here I present you the link for GBD Task Log that works for the current tasklog. Moreover with a few parameters you can access old task logs as well. Bookmark them and enjoy!!

### Sample use
---
- This Month's: https://alokshrestha.tk/GBD/GBD-Tasklog.htm *(Admit it, you need it.)*
- Last Month's (Append ?old=): https://alokshrestha.tk/GBD/GBD-Tasklog.htm?old= *(You may need for references or who knows, to copy something from previous month - Dont forget to change the date, though.)*
- Any Month's (Append ?old=mmyy where mmyy is two digit month and year; Example for Dec 2018): https://alokshrestha.tk/GBD/GBD-Tasklog.htm?old=1218 *(Who knows you may require this.)*
